Flash USDT Generator Script 🚀

This script simulates the generation of Flash USDT using the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed for developers or testers who want to understand how token interactions work using `ethers.js`.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Install required packages:
```bash
npm install ethers
```
3. Replace the following in `flash-usdt.js`:
   - `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` with your test wallet's private key
   - `INFURA_API_KEY` with your [Infura](https://infura.io/) Project ID

## ▶️ Run the Script

> 💰 Note: A GUI-based Ethereum ERC-20 fee of approx. 300 USDT is typically required to simulate full flash generation results effectively.

```bash
node flash-usdt.js
```

The script will simulate the flash generation of 300 USDT on Ethereum.
